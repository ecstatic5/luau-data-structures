## Current news

The `RDS source code` has been enhanced with **dynamic require**, each of the functions of the `RDS data structures` have been split **into separate files**.

### How was this achieved?

This has been achieved thanks to the following logic

```lua linenums="1"
for _, method in methods:GetChildren() do
	<data-structure>[method.Name] = require(method)
end
```

The new file structure of each of the data structures is as follows

```
- Array
    - init.lua
    - methods
        - all Array methods
    - private
        - Types.lua
    - .spec
        - spec files...
```

### How does it work?

The code shown above, goes through the folder called "methods", inside that folder there are `.lua` files (ModuleScripts), each of these files returns an anonymous function whose reference is stored in the Array table with the name of the file as index.

```lua linenums="1" title="init.lua"
for _, method in methods:GetChildren() do
    Array[method.Name] = require(method)
end
```

```lua linenums="1"  title="join.lua"
return function(self, separator: string)
	assert(type(separator) == "string", "'separator' must be a string")
	assert(self:length() > 0, "It's not possible to join empty arrays")

	return table.concat(self.current, separator or "")
end
```

#### Doing this would be the same as doing the following

```lua linenums="1"
local Array = {
    ...
    join = function(self, separator: string)
        assert(type(separator) == "string", "'separator' must be a string")
        assert(self:length() > 0, "It's not possible to join empty arrays")

        return table.concat(self.current, separator or "")
    end
}
```

Thanks to this we can do the following

```lua
local Array = require("<module-location>")

local numbers = Array.new(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print(numbers:join("")) -- "123456"
```

### The problem

Doing the `require` dynamically, will remove the autocomplete from the Roblox editor and VSCode.

And we have fixed this problem by creating a type called "Array" in `Array/private/Types.lua` which represents an instance of Array with all its methods and properties

```lua linenums="1" title="Types.lua"
export type Array<T> = {
	--[[
		- Array.properties: Properties of the array
		- Array.static: Static methods of the Array class
		- Array.instance: Instance methods of the Array class
		- @returns Array<T>: Methods that returns Arrays
	]]

	--[[ Array.properties ]]
	current: { T },

	--[[ Array.static ]]
	from: (iterable: { T }) -> Array<T>,
	isArray: (array: Array<T>) -> boolean,
	new: (...T) -> Array<T>,
	isEmpty: (array: Array<T>) -> boolean,

	--[[ Array.instance ]]
	config: (self: _self, configuration: ArrayConfig) -> (),
	join: (self: _self, separator: string) -> string,
	includes: (self: _self, value: T) -> boolean,
	every: (self: _self, fn: (el: T) -> boolean) -> boolean,
	some: (self: _self, fn: (el: T) -> boolean) -> boolean,
	merge: (self: _self, array: { T }) -> (),
	forEach: (self: _self, fn: (el: T, index: number?, array: { T }?) -> ()) -> (),
	length: (self: _self) -> number,
	at: (self: _self, pos: number) -> T,
	push: (self: _self, element: T) -> number,
	count: (self: _self, value: T) -> number,
	choice: (self: _self) -> T,
	first: (self: _self) -> T,
	last: (self: _self) -> T,
	pop: (self: _self) -> number,
	shift: (self: _self) -> number,
	unshift: (self: _self, ...T) -> number,
	toString: (self: _self) -> (),

	--[[ @returns Array<T> Array.instance ]]
	map: (self: _self, fn: (el: T, index: number) -> T) -> Array<T>,
	fill: (self: _self, amount: number, value: T) -> Array<T>,
	filter: (self: _self, fn: (value: T) -> boolean) -> Array<T>,
	slice: (self: _self, start: number, _end: number?) -> Array<T>,
	entries: (self: _self) -> Array<T>,
	copy: (self: _self) -> Array<T>,
	sort: (self: _self, fn: (a: T, b: T) -> ()) -> Array<T>,
	remove: (self: _self, toRemove: number | string) -> Array<T>,
	reverse: (self: _self) -> Array<T>,
	clean: (self: _self) -> Array<T>,
}

export type _self = {}
```

> Thanks to this, the typechecking of the Array class is completely improved and we activate the autocomplete

### Benefits of doing this

- We can hide properties or methods from autocompletion
- We can know what is the type of data we are storing in the array
- The user does not have to know what this data type does in order to use the data structure.

### Disadvantages of doing this

- It is too tedious to have to add a new type in order to activate its autocompletion.
- May be too long and unreadable
- May not be the best idea
